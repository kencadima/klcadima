### Hi there, I'm Ken 👋

### Some info on me...🙃 

I am advocate and enthusiast for open-source, blockchain technology, open finance, and being a good person ✌️

I'm not a great coder (yet...), so I currently run a talent consultancy helping introduce people that can code well to up and coming blockchain companies 🤝  

When I'm not emailing you about a new job, I'm reading through project documentation looking for the next big thing, attending the latest ETH conference, yield farming, or out on a run with my Australian Shepherd 🐶

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, Javascript, and Solidity
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything in the Polkadot or Ethereum ecosystem 
- 💬 Ask me about what roles I'm hiring for or for help building your team
